### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Check system metrics (e.g., using top, free, vmstat).
   - Review NGINX logs for errors or warnings.
   - Verify if any configuration or deployment changes were recently applied.

2. **Identify Potential Causes:**

   #### Issue 1: High Traffic or DDoS Attack
   - **Cause:** A sudden surge in traffic or a DDoS attack overwhelms the VM.
   - **Impact:** Memory spikes due to handling excessive connections; potential service slowdowns or crashes.
   - **Recovery Steps:**
     - Analyze traffic patterns using monitoring tools.
     - Apply rate limiting or temporarily block suspicious IP addresses.
     - Adjust firewall rules and possibly scale out the load balancer horizontally.
     - Continue monitoring to confirm stabilization.

   #### Issue 2: Memory Leak or Misconfiguration in NGINX
   - **Cause:** Bug in an NGINX module or configuration error leading to improper resource allocation.
   - **Impact:** Persistent high memory usage could eventually exhaust available memory, resulting in service failure.
   - **Recovery Steps:**
     - Restart the NGINX service to reclaim memory.
     - Audit worker process and buffer settings for misconfigurations.
     - Upgrade NGINX to a version where the memory leak is addressed.
     - Review and rollback recent configuration changes if necessary.
