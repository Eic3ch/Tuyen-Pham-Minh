## AWS Services & Rationale

- **AWS Route 53:**  
  *Provides DNS management, global routing, and health checks.*  
  _Alternative_: Third-party DNS providers.

- **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB):**  
  *Distributes incoming traffic, supports HTTP/HTTPS, and manages scaling.*  
  _Alternative_: NGINX on EC2, though less managed.

- **Auto Scaling Group (EC2/Fargate):**  
  *Ensures instances auto-scale based on load, maintaining performance for 500+ RPS.*  
  _Alternative_: Kubernetes on AWS EKS.

- **AWS RDS/Aurora:**  
  *Reliable, scalable relational database to store transactional data with high availability.*  
  _Alternative_: Self-managed MySQL/PostgreSQL on EC2.

- **AWS ElastiCache:**  
  *Improves response times by caching frequent queries, aiding p99 <100ms response time.*  
  _Alternative_: Redis on self-managed servers.

## Scalability Plans

- **Horizontal Scaling:**  
  Configure Auto Scaling Groups to add/remove compute resources based on CPU/network metrics.
  
- **Database Scaling:**  
  Use read replicas in RDS/Aurora to distribute read loads and adjust instance sizes as needed.

- **Caching:**  
  Optimize ElastiCache usage to reduce load on RDS and ensure sub-100ms p99 response times.

- **Monitoring & Alerts:**  
  Leverage CloudWatch for performance metrics and to trigger scaling actions in real time.

- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  Multi-AZ deployments and regular backups to ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
